# Beginner web course

## About 
The objective of this course is to learn to create a simple (or maybe not so simple) web application. By the end of the course, you should have a client-server web-application, with Angular frontend and Java backend.

This course is intended to be used by beginers, who have never implemented a web application before. Knowledge in programming in general is preferable.

## Methodology

You will work with Github for source versioning control. The steps for setting up the repo and a skeleton for the first protoype will be found [here](https://github.com/Ranapop/web-course/blob/master/weeks/week-1/setup.md).

In each week you will implement some functionalities. These will be divided in tasks. For each task, you will do the development on a 'dev' branch and when you are done with the task, you will request a review before merging any changes on the master. Only if changes are approved, can you merge into the master. Github will allow you to do the merge before as well, but you should not. Please take a look at the last two steps from [here](https://github.com/Ranapop/web-course/blob/master/weeks/week-1/setup.md).
