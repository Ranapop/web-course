# Beginner web course

## About 
The objective of this course is to learn to create a simple (or maybe not so simple) web application. By the end of the course, you should have client-server web-application, with Angular frontend and Java backend.

This course is intended to be used by beginers, who have never implemented a web application before. Knowledge in programming in general is preferable.
