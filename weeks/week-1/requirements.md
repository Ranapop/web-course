# The product from this week should be a non-interactive, non-responsive html page. You may add css, but no javascript is yet required.

# The tasks for this week are:
## 1) Setup workspace (basic-frontend)
Follow the [Setup tutorial](https://github.com/Ranapop/web-course/blob/master/weeks/week-1/setup.md) steps 1 to 6 to:
* create a repo
* add contributor 'Ranapop'
* download 'basic-frontend' skeleton
* put skeleton in own repo
* push changes on master (skeleton addition)

## 2) Modify the page to have four tabs
For this task you have to:
* modify the files in 'basic-frontend' to add 4 tabs
* create a dev branch
* push your changes on the dev branch
* create a pull request
* merge into 'master' only after approval (__see [Setup tutorial](https://github.com/Ranapop/web-course/blob/master/weeks/week-1/setup.md) steps 7 and 8__)

## 3) Add the first tab
You have to modify the page by adding the 'Life goals' tab:
* add the life-goals list
* add the life-goal view-edit section

__!!!Please use the 'dev' branch for development and only when the changes are done make a pull request to the 'master'.__ (same as with the previous step)
