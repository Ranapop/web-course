Once you have the 'basic-frontend' folder locally, all you have to do is open 'index.html' in a browser (double-click). The css and javascript files are already linked. You can use any editor of your chosing, and when making changes just save the file and refresh the page.

Initially, it should look like this (with a different url, of course):

![hello world](https://github.com/Ranapop/web-course/blob/master/images/tutorial/hello_world.png)
