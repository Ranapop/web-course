## 3) Interact with the life-goals list (edit mode)
In this task you have to implement a similar behaviour as for the previous task, but in the scope of this task, it should also work in edit mode. That is, if you enter edit mode (click the edit icon) and interact with the list items by selecting them, the values in the form should change accordingly.
For example, this is how it would look like when clicking on the '3 countries a year' list item while in edit mode:
