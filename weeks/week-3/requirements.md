# Overview:
This week you will add the following functionalities:
* interract with the list (select life goals)
* add new life goals
* edit existing life goals
You are free to use Javascript or jQuery.
# Tasks
## 1) [Construct the life-goals list in Javascript](tasks/task1.md) 

## 2) [Interact with the life-goals list](tasks/task2.md)

## 3) Interact with the life-goals list (edit mode)
In this task you have to implement a similar behaviour as for the previous task, but in the scope of this task, it should also work in edit mode. That is, if you enter edit mode (click the edit icon) and interact with the list items by selecting them, the values in the form should change accordingly.
For example, this is how it would look like when clicking on the '3 countries a year' list item while in edit mode:

## 3) Add a "Add life goal" button
For this task you have to:
* add a __"Add life goal"__ button underneath the life goals list (first image)
* clear the data in the form on clicking the button (second image)
